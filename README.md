key steps of the "Prediction-of-Product-Sales" project include data collection and preparation, data exploration and analysis, development and evaluation of various predictive models such as regression models, machine learning methods, and neural networks, as well as deployment and monitoring of models in production to ensure their continuous performance.
 Exploratory Data Analysis
- During the exploratory data analysis, a boxplot and histogram was visualized for each numeric datatype column. 
- Also, a barplot was visualized for each categorical column. 
- This gave a good baseline for all of the numeric and categorical columns

                  Countplots to show the frequency of the different category of entry categories

                         Boxplots for displaying statistical summaries of numerical features
